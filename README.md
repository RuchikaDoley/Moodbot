Moodbot is an interactive web application that detects the emotion behind a user’s message and responds in a way that matches their mood. It’s designed to act like a mini emotional companion—you type something in, and Moodbot figures out if you’re feeling happy, sad, or neutral, then responds with a thoughtful or uplifting message. It's a great mix of sentiment analysis and basic conversational AI, built with Python, Flask, and natural language processing (NLP).

The backend draws on a trained sentiment analysis model that classifies input as joyful, sad, fearful, and so on. But Moodbot doesn't just stop at detecting emotions-it makes the response personal. If you're down, it sends you a reassuring message or words of encouragement. If you're ecstatic, it congratulates you. This gives the app a sense of being alive and emotionally perceptive, not just analytical.

To get all this to work, the text you pass in goes through a preprocessing pipeline that cleans up the input—lowercase everything, remove punctuation, remove regular stopwords, and lemmatize words so the model can look at the underlying meaning. The cleaned-up text is then passed to the trained model, which makes the prediction of sentiment and triggers the appropriate response.

The model was trained on the Emotions Dataset for NLP in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp. In particular, the training text data file in the dataset was utilized to instruct the model on how to identify different emotions.

The project is organized into clearly defined modules: server.py handles web server and app routes, preprocessing_py.py handles cleaning of text, and a folder named SentimentAnalysis has the trained model stored in it. The frontend is built from plain HTML templates and allows users to easily interact with the bot.

Moodbot is a simple-to-work-on project for newbies that shows how emotional intelligence can be embedded in software. It's excellent for learning NLP, Flask web development, or chatbot development. It can be enhanced easily by training it on other emotions (e.g., anger, excitement, or fear), fine-tuning the model, or making the responses more dynamic. If you're curious about AI or simply want to make a sweet little web application that "felt" your mood, Moodbot's a good place to start!
